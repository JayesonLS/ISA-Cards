ISA-Cards
=========

ISA Card Designs for use in Vintage PCs.

Template
========

Status: Fits tested.

A template from which to build ISA cards. The board dimensions
around the edge connector are from an early IBM PC Technical
Reference Manual (5150 or 5160). The rear bracket positioning
has been measured from an original IBM floppy controller taken
from an IBM 5150. This board was a perfect fit when test-fitted
in an early Tandy 1000 (25-1000).

The mounting for the CF adapter has also been comfirmed in the
same Tandy 1000. It too was a perfect fit. 

There may be some variation in fit due to various tolerances. 
The fit does not seem to be very important - a wide variation
in fit has been found between various commercial ISA cards.

CF-Super-Lite
=============

Status: Untested.

A fully-contained XT-IDE compact flash board. It features a much
simplified design using only 3 ICs. It also makes use of a commonly
availalbe, inexpensive compact flash adapter with integrated 
mounting bracket.
