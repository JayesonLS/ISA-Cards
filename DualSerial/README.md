A simple ISA card adding two serial (COM) ports to a vintage PC. 
Created with early Tandy 1000's in mind which have no COM ports from the factory.

Before installing, configure the port selection jumpers to COM ports not yet present 
in the system. Details are located on the board by the port jumpers.

Configure the IRQ jumpers to an approriate selection. For no IRQ, remove the IRQ jumper.
Suggested IRQ settings are located on the board by the IRQ jumpers.
